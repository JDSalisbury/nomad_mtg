It started with a ride.

Somewhere between the winding roads, the smell of fuel, and the freedom of an open highway, I started wondering if I could bring _Magic: The Gathering_ along for the journey — not as cargo, but as a companion. Not to be weighed down by it, but to carry it lightly. Just like my favorite rides, I wanted the game to be _portable_, _stripped down_, and _focused on the experience_.

That’s how **Nomad** came to be.

At first, it was just a thought experiment:  
**“How could I play Magic while backpacking, camping, or sitting outside a mountain-town coffee shop with friends?”**  
But it quickly turned into something more — a personal mission to merge two of my favorite pastimes: traveling and tabletop strategy. I wanted the best of both worlds. And surprisingly, it was more than possible. It felt… _natural_.

But to make it work, the game needed a makeover.  
A lighter footprint. Less noise. No tokens, no counters, no piles of extra cardboard. Just 40 cards, a sideboard, and a single D20. No clutter. No complicated state tracking. No tap-dancing around triggers. Just gameplay.

## A Reaction to the Modern Game

Don’t get me wrong — I love a well-built dice factory deck. There’s real joy in spinning that engine and watching the board explode. But lately, especially with the release of sets like _Bloomburrow_, I’ve felt something shift. Magic has grown heavier — more components, more bookkeeping, more “don’t forget this trigger or you’ll lose.”

It started feeling less like a game and more like a spreadsheet.

That’s fine for a Friday night with all the gear laid out. But when you’re outdoors with a friend and a backpack, it's a dealbreaker. And even off the trail, I’ve found myself craving something leaner. I want _decisions_ and _tactics_, not upkeep phases that need a checklist.

**Nomad is my answer to that.**

## Why These Rules?

The core of Nomad is simplicity without sacrificing depth.

- **Singleton format**  
  Keeps games varied, replayable, and skill-testing — without the need for deck multiples.

- **40-card main deck + 20-card sideboard**  
  Easy to carry, fast to shuffle, and quick to play.

- **No tokens, counters, or extra components**  
  You bring your deck and a D20 — that's it.

- **Legacy banlist + Nomad-specific exclusions**  
  Powerful cards stay in check, and we avoid pieces that depend on external components.

Some cards just don’t make sense in a travel-first environment. Anything that creates multiple objects, needs detailed tracking, or asks you to bring extra cards into the game — it’s out. The goal is clarity, not compromise.

## A Living Format

Nomad isn’t “done.” It’s growing — much like the places I plan to bring it.

I see it evolving with the needs of travelers, hikers, and hostel-dwellers who want to sling spells without lugging around half a game store. I want feedback, tests, and matches played under open skies or between train rides.

This isn’t just a format. It’s an invitation:  
**take Magic with you**, not as baggage, but as a companion. Pack light. Play smart. Make memories.

And if you're reading this and thinking,  
**“That’s exactly what I’ve been missing,”** —  
welcome, fellow Nomad. There’s room at the table (or stump, or rock, or cafe bench) for you too.
