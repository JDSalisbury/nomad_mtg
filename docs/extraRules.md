### **❤️ Life Total**

- Starting life: 20
- Maximum life: 20
- Life gain cannot exceed this cap
  - If you’re at 18 and gain 5 life, your life becomes 20 — not 23
- Cards that reference how much life you’ve gained will only count the actual change

### **🔁 Sideboarding**

- 20-card sideboard
- Encourages transformative post-board experiences
- Decks can significantly shift playstyle between games
- While traveling, players may freely change their Game 1 configuration between sessions for variety
