### **ðŸš«Banlist Philosophy**

- Nomad follows the Legacy format ban list as a baseline for card legality and power balance.
- All Nomad-specific gameplay restrictions (e.g., no tokens, no counters, no extra game pieces) are enforced on top of the Legacy ban list.
- Cards legal in Legacy but disallowed by Nomadâ€™s rules (e.g., Bitterblossom, Wasteland, Uro, Titan of Natureâ€™s Wrath) are also banned.
- Because Nomad is a singleton format, players may use one copy of any legal card unless it is banned under these combined restrictions.

Given the singelton nature of the format some of the legacy cards might not be as degenerate in this format.
Notable cards on Legacy banlist that aren't Banned in Nomad:

- Arcum's Astrolabe
- Expressive Iteration
- Gitaxian Probe
- Gush
- Mana Drain
- Mind Twist
- Skull Clamp
- Sowing Mycospawn
