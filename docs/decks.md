## Deck Tech: Singleton Reanimator with Combo Pivots

This deck is built around a core **Reanimator strategy**, leveraging cards like _Entomb_, _Reanimate_, _Animate Dead_, and _Shallow Grave_ to cheat massive threats like _Griselbrand_, _Atraxa, Grand Unifier_, and _Archon of Cruelty_ into play as early as turn one. Disruption in the form of _Unmask_, _Cabal Therapy_, and _Thoughtseize_ helps clear the way, while cantrips like _Ponder_ and _Preordain_ keep the engine consistent. The deck can also pivot into an alternate combo line with _Chain of Smog_ and _Witherbloom Apprentice_, allowing for an instant-speed win through storm-like loops. Flexible spells like _Dark Ritual_ and _Lotus Petal_ fuel both primary and alternate win conditions, making the list explosive and hard to disrupt.

What sets this build apart is its modular sideboard that supports **combo pivoting**. If the graveyard plan is hated out, the deck can shift into a _Painter's Servant + Grindstone_ combo, or use _Sneak Attack_ as another way to cheat fatties into play without relying on reanimation. This transformation allows the deck to stay aggressive against slower opponents or adapt into a midrange/control hybrid with answers like _Abrupt Decay_, _Flame of Anor_, and _Strategic Betrayal_. With these pivots, the deck maintains resilience and unpredictability, making it a potent weapon in any singleton metagame.

## Deck Tech: Singleton UWx Stoneblade Control

This deck is a **UWx Stoneblade-style control build** with a strong _equipment subtheme_ and a mix of efficient interaction, card selection, and resilient threats. At its core, it plays like a classic blue-based control deck, with staples like _Force of Will_, _Brainstorm_, _Ponder_, _Snapcaster Mage_, and _Swords to Plowshares_ enabling card advantage and tempo plays. The addition of _Stoneforge Mystic_ alongside _Sword of Fire and Ice_, _Sword of Feast and Famine_, and _Buster Sword_ creates a powerful tutor package that can end games quickly once control is established. _Cloud, Midgar Mercenary_ and _Triumph of Saint Katherine_ provide midgame board presence, while _True-Name Nemesis_ and _Vendilion Clique_ bring evasive pressure and disruption.

The sideboard allows the deck to pivot into **a more aggressive, midrange equipment deck** or lean into _pure control_. Cards like _Baneslayer Angel_, _Sigarda, Host of Herons_, and _Assimilation Aegis_ offer alternative win conditions and late-game inevitability. Tools like _Flusterstorm_, _Blue Elemental Blast_, and _Negate_ shore up the stack-based matchups, while _Tormod's Crypt_, _Relic of Progenitus_, and _Containment Priest_ give strong graveyard interaction. Equipment-specific tools like _Cryptic Coat_, _Dissection Tools_, and _Deconstruction Hammer_ support Stoneforge pivots, allowing you to sidestep traditional control paths and go for quicker kills when needed.

## Deck Tech: Singleton Red Burn

This list is a **singleton Red Burn deck**, optimized for raw speed, reach, and punishing greedy mana bases. It leans into the traditional burn strategy with hyper-efficient spells like _Lightning Bolt_, _Chain Lightning_, _Lava Spike_, and _Skewer the Critics_, while supporting them with flexible threats like _Monastery Swiftspear_, _Slickshot Show-Off_, and _Goblin Guide_. Cards like _Fireblast_, _Price of Progress_, and _Flame Rift_ offer high-risk, high-reward closers that can end games quickly, while _Light Up the Stage_ and _Needle Drop_ keep the fuel flowing. With cards like _Grim Lavamancer_ and _Violent Urge_, the deck also gains incremental value that helps it push through slower, grindier matchups.

The sideboard gives the deck several ways to **pivot based on matchup needs**. Against combo and control, _Eidolon of the Great Revel_, _Roiling Vortex_, and _Red Elemental Blast_ increase the pressure while _Mindbreak Trap_ gives surprise interaction. Against graveyards or creature recursion, _Leyline of the Void_ and _Ashen Rider_ can swing tempo. _Null Rod_, _Pithing Needle_, and _Alpine Moon_ disable problematic permanents, while _Ensnaring Bridge_ gives a way to play defensively if forced into a long game. The inclusion of _Fury_ and _Pyroclasm_ supports creature-based meta defense, while _Dragon’s Claw_ gives you game against other burn decks. The deck remains focused but flexible, always ready to pivot — or just go face.
