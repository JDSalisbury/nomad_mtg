title: Banlist Policy
---

### **ðŸš«Banlist Philosophy**

- Nomad follows the Legacy format ban list as a baseline for card legality and power balance.
- All Nomad-specific gameplay restrictions (e.g., no tokens, no counters, no extra game pieces) are enforced on top of the Legacy ban list.
- Cards legal in Legacy but disallowed by Nomadâ€™s rules (e.g., Bitterblossom, Wasteland, Uro, Titan of Natureâ€™s Wrath) are also banned.
- Because Nomad is a singleton format, players may use one copy of any legal card unless it is banned under these combined restrictions.
